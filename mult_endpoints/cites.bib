Abstract = {{This paper proposes a Dunnett-Bonferroni-based parallel gatekeeping
   procedure in a setting of dose-response clinical trials with multiple
   endpoints. It follows the Dunnett-based parallel gatekeeping strategy
   of Dmitrienko et al. (Pharm. Stat. 2006, 5:19-28), but differs in the
   calculation of the critical values. The implementation of the
   Dunnett-based parallel gatekeeping procedure relies on assumptions
   difficult to justify in typical clinical trials, namely (a) that the
   joint distribution of the test statistics from different endpoints can
   be approximated by a multivariate-t distribution and (b) that the true
   correlation between multiple endpoints can be well estimated using
   observed data. The proposed Dunnett-Bonferroni-based parallel
   gatekeeping procedure relaxes the preceding assumptions by splitting
   type I error rate among families using the Bonferroni inequality. While
   it is potentially less powerful than a Dunnett-based procedure when
   both procedures are applicable, the power loss is very minimal. Our
   proposed method avoids assumptions that might be challenged by
   regulatory agencies and does so with virtually no cost. Moreover, in
   most cases this method is easier to implement compared with the
   Dunnett-based procedure. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For clinical trials with multiple treatment arms or endpoints a variety
   of sequentially rejective, weighted Bonferroni-type tests have been
   proposed, such as gatekeeping procedures, fixed sequence tests, and
   fallback procedures. They allow to map the difference in importance as
   well as the relationship between the various research questions onto an
   adequate multiple test procedure. Since these procedures rely on the
   closed test principle, they usually require the explicit specification
   of a large number of intersection hypotheses tests. The underlying test
   strategy may therefore be difficult to communicate. We propose a simple
   iterative graphical approach to construct and perform such
   Bonferroni-type tests. The resulting multiple test procedures are
   represented by directed. weighted graphs, where each node corresponds
   to an elementary hypothesis, together with a simple algorithm to
   generate such graphs while sequentially testing the individual
   hypotheses. The approach is illustrated with the visualization of
   several common gatekeeping strategies. A case study is used to
   illustrate how the methods from this article can be used to tailor a
   multiple test procedure to given study objectives. Copyright (C) 2008

Abstract = {{In a typical clinical trial, there are one or two primary endpoints,
   and a few secondary endpoints. When at least one primary endpoint
   achieves statistical significance, there is considerable interest in
   using results for the secondary endpoints to enhance characterization
   of the treatment effect. Because multiple endpoints are involved,
   regulators may require that the familywise type I error rate be
   controlled at a pre-set level. This requirement can be achieved by
   using ``gatekeeping{''} methods. However, existing methods suffer from
   logical oddities such as allowing results for secondary endpoint(s) to
   impact the likelihood of success for the primary endpoint(s). We
   propose a novel and easy-to-implement gatekeeping procedure that is
   devoid of such deficiencies. A real data example and simulation results
   are used to illustrate efficiency gains of our method relative to
   existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem Of simultaneously testing multiple one-sided
   null hypotheses. Single-step procedures, such as the Bonferroni test,
   are characterized by the fact that the rejection or non-rejection of a
   null hypothesis does not take the decision for ally other hypothesis
   into account. For stepwise test procedures, such as the Holin
   procedure, the rejection or non-rejection of a null hypothesis may
   depend oil the decision of other hypotheses. It is well known that
   stepwise test procedures are by construction more powerful than their
   single-step Counterparts. This power advantage. however, comes Only at
   the cost of increased difficulties ill constructing compatible
   Simultaneous confidence intervals for the parameters of interest. For
   example, Such Simultaneous confidence intervals are easily obtained for
   the Bonferroni method, but surprisingly hard to derive for the Holm
   procedure. In this paper, we discuss the inherent problems and show
   that ad hoc Solutions used in practice typically do not control the
   pre-specified simultaneous confidence level. Instead, we derive
   simultaneous confidence intervals that are compatible with it certain

Abstract = {{A popular method to control multiplicity in confirmatory clinical
   trials is to use a so-called hierarchical, or fixed sequence, test
   procedure. This requires that the null hypotheses are ordered a priori,
   for example, in order of clinical importance. The procedure tests the
   hypotheses in this order using a-level tests until one is not rejected.
   It then stops, so that no subsequent hypotheses are eligible for
   rejection. This procedure strongly controls the familywise error rate
   (FWE), that is to say, the probability that any true hypotheses are
   rejected.
   This paper describes a simple generalization of this approach in which
   the null hypotheses are partially ordered. It is convenient to display
   the partial ordering in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We consider
   sequentially rejective procedures based on the partial ordering, in
   which a hypothesis is tested only when all preceding hypotheses have
   been tested and rejected. In general such procedures do not control the
   FWE, but it is shown that when certain intersection hypotheses are
   added, strong control of the FWE is obtained. The purpose of the method
   is to construct inference strategies for confirmatory clinical trials
   that better reflect the trial objectives. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Multiplicity adjustment in general is currently a controversial topic.
   This review focuses on the proof of efficacy in randomized clinical
   trials. The ICH guidelines mandate control of the familywise error
   rate. Confidence intervals are clinically more appropriate than
   P-values or yes/no decisions. Therefore, simultaneous confidence
   intervals are proposed for several designs and aims in clinical trials.
   The computation of simultaneous confidence intervals for the difference
   or the ratio is demonstrated by means of real data examples using the
   R-packages multcomp and mratios. A special problem is the evaluation of
   dose-finding trials with and without the assumption that the effects
   increase with increasing doses. Simultaneous intervals are presented
   not only for one-way layouts and normal distributed endpoints, but also
   for higher way layouts, generalized linear models, and mixed models.
   Under importance ordering, the conditional testing of all hypotheses at
   level alpha will be shown using the intersection-union test principle.
   Other multiplicity issues (i.e. multiple endpoints, multiple analyses,
   and subgroup analyses) are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In testing multiple hypotheses, control of the familywise error rate is
   often considered. We develop a procedure called the ``fallback
   procedure{''} to control the familywise error rate when multiple
   primary hypotheses are tested. With the fallback procedure, the Type I
   error rate (alpha) is partitioned among the various hypotheses of
   interest. Unlike the standard Bonferroni adjustment, however, testing
   hypotheses proceeds in an order determined a priori. As long as
   hypotheses are rejected, the Type I error rate can be accumulated,
   making tests of later hypotheses more powerful than under the
   Bonferroni procedure. Unlike the fixed sequence test, the fallback test
   allows consideration of all hypotheses even if one or more hypotheses
   are not rejected early in the process, thereby avoiding a common
   concern about the fixed sequence procedure. We develop properties of
   the fallback procedure, including control of the familywise error rate
   for an arbitrary number of hypotheses via illustrating the procedure as
   a closed testing procedure, as well as making the test more powerful
   via alpha exhaustion. We compare it to other procedures for controlling
   familywise error rates, finding that the fallback procedure is a viable
   alternative to the fixed sequence procedure when there is some doubt
   about the power for the first hypothesis. These results expand on the
   previously developed properties of the fallback procedure ( Wiens,
   2003). Several examples are discussed to illustrate the relative
   advantages of the fallback procedure.}},
