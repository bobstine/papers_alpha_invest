		Dull look at allocating alpha to initial and
		subsequent tests.  He sets the overall alpha to 0.10
		and then gives 0.05 to main and another 0.05 
		to the secondary.  We do that in some sense automatically.

		More philosophical about whether appropriate to allocate
		alpha; different investigators have different conclusions
		depending on how alpha is allocated.

		Starts with alpha=0.1 overall with 0.05 for primary H0.

		Ducks the issue of dependence.  Says that one can adjust
		but leaves that to the specific application.

Examples of use  
	(from http://onbiostatistics.blogspot.com/2009/05/
	adjustment-for-multiplicity.html)

	It is always useful to refer to the statistical review documents 
	for previous NDA/BLA to see which kind of approaches have been 
	used in drug approval process. Three approaches below seem to 
	stand out.
		Hochberg procedure
		Bonferroni-Holm procedure
		Hierarchical order for testing null hypotheses
	
	Bonferroni-Holm procedure is based on Holm's paper in 1979 
	(Holm, S (1979): "A simple sequentially rejective multiple test 
	procedure", Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 6:65–70). 
	It is a modification to the original method. This method may 
	also be called Holm-Bonferroni approach or Bonferroni-Holm 
	correction. This approach was employed in Flomax NDA (020579). 
	and BLA for HFM-582 (STN 125057).

	Both Holm's procedure and Hochberg's procedure are modifications 
	from the Bonferroni procedure. Holm's procedure is called 
	'step-down procedure' and Hochberg's procedure is called 
	'step-up procedure'. An article by Huang and Hsu titled 
	"Hochberg's step-up method: cutting corners off Holm's step-down 
	method" (Biometrika 2007 94(4):965-975) provided a good 
	comparison of these two procedures.

	Benjamini-Hochberg also proposed a new procedure which controls
	 the FDR (false discovery rate) instead of controlling the 
	overall alpha level. The original paper by Benjamin and Hochberg 
	is titled "controlling the false discovery rate: a practical 
	and powerful approach to multiple testing" appeared in Journal
	 of the Royal Statistical Society. it is interesting that the
	 FDR and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure has been pretty often used
	 in the gene identification/microarray area.  Another good summary 
	is the slides from  2004 FDA/Industry statistics workshop.
